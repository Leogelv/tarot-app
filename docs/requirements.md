# Tarot Mobile App Requirements

## 1. General Idea and Purpose

1. **Main Goal**: Create a modern and appealing Tarot app that helps users:
   * Learn about Tarot cards and their meanings
   * Create simple spreads and receive interpretations in an accessible form
   * Use the app daily (card of the day, affirmations, small notes/journal)

2. **Key Focus**: Friendly, "cute" design, primarily targeting a female audience (but not exclusively), with a more "playful", warm, and light style compared to most "dark" or "classical" Tarot apps.

3. **Visual Aesthetic**: References to "Alice in Wonderland", pastel colors, possible focus on a rabbit (mascot character). The idea is to create a light, magical, but not overly detailed atmosphere.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Tarot Knowledge Base**:
   * Description of all 78 cards (Major and Minor Arcana)
   * Interpretations oriented toward modern lifestyle
   * Possibility (in the future) to generate individual interpretations based on user data or question context (via AI/neural network)

2. **Card of the Day**:
   * Daily "random" card to encourage users to open the app every day
   * Possibly a short advice/forecast for this card in a modern style (similar to a "daily horoscope", but based on Tarot)

3. **Various Spreads**:
   * Set of classic spreads (e.g., "three cards", "Celtic Cross", etc.)
   * Ability to add new spreads (easier and more modern) or custom spreads using templates

4. **Affirmations**:
   * Additional "positive" function to engage and retain users
   * Generation of short inspiring phrases, preferably related to the drawn card/spread

5. **Interactivity and Animation**:
   * Simple but "lively" animation when selecting/shuffling cards, when "revealing" the card of the day, etc.
   * Sound effects (light and unobtrusive)
   * Ability to "communicate" with a character (e.g., rabbit) who reminds about the daily card, suggests making a spread, etc.

6. **Personal Journal/Notes**:
   * Section for user notes: users can write down thoughts and results of spreads
   * Prompts "what to write" after a spread (e.g., "what emotions did you experience?")

7. **AI Chat** (optional, for advanced version):
   * User formulates a question, AI analyzes a conditional "spread" and provides a text response
   * Such a chatbot can act as a "friendly guide" to the cards

## 3. Monetization

1. **Subscription Model**:
   * Subscription with a 7-day free trial period
   * Price ~$50/€50/£50 per year (or equivalent) to avoid seeming too expensive
   * Can offer subscription options: monthly, yearly, lifetime with different prices

2. **Additional Paid Features**:
   * Extended spreads
   * Full access to the card database (although a basic set can be provided for free)
   * Exclusive affirmations or advanced journal with synchronization
   * Optional AI-based chatbot in paid subscription (or with a limit on free questions)

## 4. Design and UX Features

1. **Design Approach**:
   * "Pastel fairy tale" without excessive childishness
   * Stylized card illustrations: same traditional subjects but in a "cute" style
   * "Friendly" interface, clear navigation

2. **Daily Engagement**:
   * Push notifications: "Your card of the day is ready!", "Time to make a spread", etc.
   * Regular small "rewards" (animation, mini-cards, inspiring phrases) to make users want to return

3. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
   * Card database with interpretations
   * Card of the day (with push notification)
   * A few spreads
   * Trial period and subscription
   * Basic feature with animation/interactive mascot (rabbit)

## 5. Marketing and Promotion

1. **Target Audience**:
   * Largely female (teenagers and adults 20-35)
   * People interested in astrology, metaphorical cards, spiritual practices, light esotericism

2. **Main Channels**:
   * TikTok - content with examples of spreads, fun or inspiring stories
   * Instagram (Reels) - similar content, targeting female audience

3. **Content Strategy**:
   * Short videos about card meanings
   * Real (or "playful") stories "Here's what came up today"
   * Demonstration of cute UI/animations in the app
   * Affirmations, advice, memes about Tarot

## 6. Technical Details and Languages

1. **Language Localization**:
   * At minimum English
   * Possibility to add Spanish (large audience), German, Italian, French, etc.
   * Multilingualism will allow scaling through global demand

2. **Technology Stack**:
   * iOS/Android application (cross-platform or native development)
   * Server/backend for storing user data (though note storage can be done locally, depending on the design)
   * Optionally - integration with AI/ChatGPT (or other LLMs) for chatbot and "dynamic" card descriptions

3. **UI Animations**:
   * Special attention to card shuffling animation, card of the day selection, card "flipping"
   * Simple but "magical" effects (page-turning sounds, light vibration, light flashes when drawing a card, etc.)

4. **Monetization via App Store / Google Play**:
   * Support for in-app purchases (subscription)
   * Seven-day free trial period

## 7. Possible Additional Ideas

1. **Gamification**:
   * Levels and "achievements" for regular use (e.g., drew a card 7 days in a row - get a special background or "golden" rabbit)
   * Ability to "unlock" new spreads as you progress or accumulate conditional "points"

2. **Social Functions**:
   * Share "card of the day" results on social media (with beautiful design)
   * Community within the app (comments on spreads?), but this is more complex to implement

3. **Extended Spreads / Tarot Courses**:
   * For advanced users, can offer training materials/mini-video lessons within the app

## Summary

For the Tarot app to stand out in the market, it's important to combine:
* Pleasant and "playful" design (minimum darkness, maximum soft and pastel tones)
* Regular engagement (card of the day, affirmations, rabbit mascot, and push notifications)
* Modern card interpretations that resemble "lifestyle horoscopes" - people understand simple formulations
* Multilingualism (as a way to go beyond the local market)
* Convenient paid subscription (with reasonable price, trial period, and clear benefits)
